About project

In this Python Project, I had used open cv library accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. I used the models trained by svm. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’.

Dataset :
For this python project, I had used the Adience dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it kaggel. This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. The images have been collected from Flickr albums and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges (as mentioned above) and is about 1GB in size. The models I used had been trained on this dataset.
